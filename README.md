## 📄 About Me

Hello! I'm Mehul, an enthusiastic and dedicated student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) at Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalaya, Bhopal. My journey in tech began early and has evolved into a passion for building smart systems that solve real-world problems. I am particularly motivated by AI’s transformative potential in healthcare, finance, security, and beyond.

With a solid foundation in Data Structures, OOP, Probability & Statistics, and practical experience with Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, I enjoy developing and optimizing ML models on real-world data. My interests extend to prompt engineering, generative AI, and responsible AI development.

As a core member of NexGen Devs, I'm actively participating in the Smart India Hackathon 2024, working on AI-powered solutions for security, fraud prevention, disaster management, and media authenticity. My academic journey is marked by a CGPA of 9.6 in the first year and a commitment to advanced AI topics—especially cybersecurity, fraud detection, and energy efficiency.
